**Random Quote:** _Lebesgue's first papers angered classical
mathematicians. The very title of one of them, "On unruled developable
surfaces," seemed to them as outlandish as, say, "On gaseous ice" to a
physicist or "On fishlike elephants" to a biologist._ -- N. Ya.
Vilenkin, "In Search of Infinity"
